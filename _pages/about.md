In 2020, I received a Film Production degree from the University of Salford. Since then, I've established FX Raven, my own production firm. For all phases of your customer experience, I specialise in producing engaging video content. Our bundle packages are expertly curated to meet your increasing marketing demand.

I encourage creativity in others, and I can work with your firm to generate video material that fits your needs at a fair price. I can also strengthen your brand by providing assistance with all facets of video and editing. I specialise in creating family and business videos, animations, social media engagement videos, and expert interviews.Â 

Here at FXRaven, we always have the solutions you need thanks to our diverse network.
