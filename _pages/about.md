I was awarded a degree in Film Production from the University of Salford in 2018.   Since then, I have founded my own production company FX Raven.  I specialise in creating exciting video content for all stages of your customer journey.

I inspire creativity in others and can create video content in partnership with your company to fit your budget at a reasonable cost and can enhance your brand by offering all aspects of video and editing support.  I specialise in family and corporate videos, animations, promotional videos for social media engagement and expert interviews.
